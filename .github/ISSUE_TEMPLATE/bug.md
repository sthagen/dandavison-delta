Hi, thanks for filing a Delta bug report!

One thing that can be very helpful is to include the raw git / diff output in your issue description, so that we can reproduce the problem. (You can use `git --no-pager`) to tell git to temporarily do something without using Delta.) A screenshot of Delta's output on that input is often helpful also.

Also, please be explicit about what you were expecting to happen / what it should look like.

But please don't hesitate to go ahead and create the issue -- the most important thing is that we have a record of things that are wrong.
